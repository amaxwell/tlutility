#summary TeX Live Utility Preferences.

= Settings =

TeX Live Utility is designed to have as few settings as possible.  These are available via the Preferences window:

http://mactlmgr.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Prefs.png

== Server URL ==

This is the [http://ctan.org CTAN] mirror that will be used for update and installation.

== TeX programs ==

For a standard MacTeX installation, this will be /usr/texbin.  You can choose an alternate location, but the tlmgr command-line should exist at this location.

== Install updates for all users ==

This is equivalent to using {{{sudo -H tlmgr}}}, and avoids conflicts with packages installed in your home directory.  See the [http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php?title=TeX_Live_Manager MacTeX wiki] for discussion.

== Show progress in system log ==

Copies the output from TeX Live Utility's console pane to the system log, so it can be read with Console.app.
