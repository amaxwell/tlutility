= Settings =

TeX Live Utility is designed to have as few settings as possible.  Window setup such as table column widths should be preserved, along with the split view bar location.

== Table Fonts ==

If you don't like Monaco 10 for a table font, you can easily change it to the font of your choice.  Select a row in the table, and use the standard Edit->Font->Show Fonts menu item to change it.  Your changes will be persistent.

== Preferences Window ==

The remaining user-settable preferences are available via the Preferences window:

== TeX programs ==

For a standard MacTeX installation, this will be /usr/texbin.  You can choose an alternate location, as long as the tlmgr command-line tool exists at this location.

== Install updates for all users ==

This is equivalent to using {{{sudo -H tlmgr}}}, and avoids conflicts with packages installed in your home directory.  See the [http://mactex-wiki.tug.org/wiki/index.php?title=TeX_Live_Manager MacTeX wiki] for discussion.

== Show progress in system log ==

Copies the output from TeX Live Utility's console pane to the system log, so it can be read with Console.app.
