#summary Basic features of TeX Live Utility.

= Introduction =

The primary feature of TeX Live Utility is updating a MacTeX installation.  When first launching the program, this is the screen that will be visible:

= Updating =

To update all packages, use the "Update All" toolbar button or menu item.  Individual packages can also be updated by selecting them in the list and using the "Update" toolbar button or menu item.

The "Update All" action will also remove and install packages to match the TeX Live database on the remote server. 

= Installing =

Packages can be installed using the "Manage Packages" tab:

Note that some packages have multiple architectures, and you generally only want to install the darwin version for Mac OS X.  This is not a generic package installer.  Only TeX Live packages that exist on the server will be listed.

= Paper Size =

Use the Actions menu to change paper size.  The current paper size is given by pdftex, but changing paper size will change it for _all_ TeX programs.  If you want to change paper size for a single program, e.g. dvips, use the tlmgr command-line tool.

= Show Info =

You can display detailed information for a specific package in an inspector panel:
