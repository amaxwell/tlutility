#summary Basic features of TeX Live Utility.

= Introduction =

The primary feature of TeX Live Utility is updating a MacTeX installation.  When first launching the program, this is the screen that will be visible:

Installed and Remote columns show the TeX Live version number for the package.  Size shows the installed size in bytes.

= Updating =

To update all packages, use the "Update All" toolbar button or menu item.  Individual packages can also be updated by selecting them in the list and using the "Update" toolbar button or menu item.

The "Update All" action will also remove and install packages to match the TeX Live database on the remote server. 

= Installing =

Packages can be installed using the "Manage Packages" tab:

Note that some packages have multiple architectures, and you generally only want to install the darwin version for Mac OS X.  This is not a generic package installer.  Only TeX Live packages that exist on the server will be listed.

= Paper Size =

Use the Actions menu to change paper size.  The current paper size is given by pdftex, but changing paper size will change it for _all_ TeX programs.  If you want to change paper size for a single program, e.g. dvips, use the tlmgr command-line tool.

= Autobackup =

Use the Actions menu to change automatic backup settings (only tested with TeX Live 2010).  If you want to keep all backups, enter âˆž for the number to keep.  If the "Prune backups" box is checked, old backups will be removed, excluding the number specified for keeping.

Restoring backups currently requires use of the tlmgr command in Terminal.  Refer to the [http://tug.org/texlive/doc/tlmgr.html tlmgr manual] for more details.
