= Introduction =

TeX Live Utility can be used with any CTAN mirror.  Most users should use the default URL of [http://mirror.ctan.org] which picks a nearby host for you to spread out the load, but sometimes you need to use a particular URL.

To change the URL, you can edit the address field at the top of the main window, or drag-and-drop a URL from another source, such as a web browser or the Finder.  If the URL is invalid or does not have the correct TeX Live version, an alert will be presented.

The address field has autocompletion, so if you start typing any part of a known URL, it will show a drop-down list of possible matches.  To select one, hit return, then return again to actually load the URL.

In general, the user interface is inspired by web browsers, but has additional validation steps for URLs.

= Mirror Window =

To manage the list of known mirrors, choose the *Configure->Manage Mirrors* menu item.  This will give a window similar to this one:

== Home Mirror ==

Your home mirror (the one used when TeX Live Utility starts up) is shown in boldface.  To change it, use the button at the bottom of the window, or the *Configure->Set as Home Mirror* menu item.  You can use the Home button next to the address field in Tex Live Utility's main window to reload using the home mirror, which may be useful if you temporarily edited the field.

== Adding Mirrors ==

To add a new mirror, you can use the “+” button at the bottom of the window, or drop it under the “OTHER MIRRORS” outline heading.  This is where you should add [http://tlcontrib.metatex.org/ TLContrib], for instance, or a private repository.  The by-continent list of mirrors comes from parsing [http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/CTAN.sites CTAN.sites] and is not editable.
