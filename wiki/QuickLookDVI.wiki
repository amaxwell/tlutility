#summary Quick Look plugin for DVI files.
#labels Featured

= Installation =

If you download TeX Live Utility, the DVI Quick Look plugin is already installed, and you don't need to do anything else if dvipdfmx can be found at /usr/texbin/dvipdfmx.  If you don't use TeX Live Utility, download the plugin separately and install it in ~/Library/QuickLook or /Library/QuickLook.


= Usage =

DVI files will now have a thumbnail icon available in Finder, and in TeX Live Utility's documentation file view (and BibDesk's linked file view).

= Configuration =

You can change the dvipdfmx path with `defaults write com.googlecode.mactlmgr.qlgenerator.DVI DvipdfmxPathKey /full/path/to/dvipdfmx` in Terminal.  You may need to use `qlmanage -r` to reset Quick Look generators after this.
