"""Pure python script for generating binary files for DataTank.  The 
internal details of the file format were determined from DTSource:

http://www.visualdatatools.com/DTSource.html

This script is a mixture of functionality from several objects in
DTSource, including DTDataFile, and DTStorage, with other parts
taken as needed from the Write() implementation of various objects.
The intent is not to duplicate all of the functionality of DTSource,
but allow saving the results of computations in objects that are
easily readable by DataTank.  High-level objects such as meshes
and images can be handled specially as needed, but they're really
just specially-named collections of DTArray objects.

The API is strongly centered around what I need for DataTank, and
I've explicitly avoided trying to overdesign this by adding lots of
classes.  I'd probably drop this entirely in favor of SWIG bindings
for DTSource, or maybe even Python modules wrapping the C++ classes,
but I don't have time to do that myself.

    Higher-level access is provided for some objects (e.g., PIL image),
    but it is primarily for writing arrays and strings.  In fact, all
    DataTank stores is arrays and strings, with naming conventions to
    define how they're interpreted.
    
    You should not have multiple DTDataFile instances open for the same
    file on disk, or your file's state will get trashed.
    
    Reading values is fairly easy, and DTDataFile provides a 
    dictionary-style interface to the variables.  For example,
    assuming that a variable named "Array_One" exists:
    
    >>> f = DTDataFile("a.dtbin")
    >>> v = f["Array_One"]
    
    Setting is similar, but you're at the mercy of the type conversion
    as in the write() method, and you can't specify a time:
    
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> f = DTDataFile("a.dtbin")
    >>> f["My array"] = np.zeros((2, 2))
    >>> f["My array"]
    array([[ 0.,  0.],
           [ 0.,  0.]])
           
    Note that if you try to set the same variable name again,
    an exception will be thrown.  Don't do that.
    
    You can also iterate a DTDataFile directly, and each iteration
    returns a variable name.  Variable names are unordered, as in
    hashing collections.
    
    DTDataFile supports the with statement in Python 2.5 and 2.6,
    so you can use this idiom to ensure resources are cleaned up:
    >>> with DTDataFile("foo.dtbin", truncate=True) as df:
    ...     df.write_2dmesh_one(mesh, 0, 0, dx, dy, "FooBar")
