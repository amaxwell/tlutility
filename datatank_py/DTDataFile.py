"""DTDataFile.py

Pure python script for generating binary files for DataTank.  The 
internal details of the file format were determined from DTSource:

http://www.visualdatatools.com/DTSource.html

This script is a mixture of functionality from several objects in
DTSource, including DTDataFile, and DTStorage, with other parts
taken as needed from the Write() implementation of various objects.
The intent is not to duplicate all of the functionality of DTSource,
but allow saving the results of computations in objects that are
easily readable by DataTank.  High-level objects such as meshes
and images can be handled specially as needed, but they're really
just specially-named collections of DTArray objects.

The API is strongly centered around what I need for DataTank, and
I've explicitly avoided trying to overdesign this by adding lots of
classes.  I'd probably drop this entirely in favor of SWIG bindings
for DTSource, or maybe even Python modules wrapping the C++ classes,
but I don't have time to do that myself.
