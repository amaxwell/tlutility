/** @brief Concrete subclass of NSTask.
 
 NSTask is not listed as thread safe in Apple's documentation.  At least in 10.4 and prior, its implementation allows the parent/child relationship to be lost (somehow), possibly by observing SIGCHLD in a thread-unsafe way.  Among other problems, this causes unexpected exceptions to be raised, and termination to not work correctly.  
 
 BDSKTask is designed to be thread safe insofar as instances can be created and launched from threads other than the AppKit thread.  If the task is accessed from multiple threads, use a lock to protect it.
 
 BDSKTask guarantees that NSTaskDidTerminateNotification will be posted on the thread that called BDSKTask::launch.
 
 Exceptions should only be raised for violation of the API contract (e.g. calling BDSKTask::terminationStatus while the task is still running, or setting the launch path after the task has launched).
