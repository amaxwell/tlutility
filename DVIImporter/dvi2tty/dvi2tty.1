.SH NAME
dvi2tty \- preview a dvi\-file on an ordinary ascii terminal
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dvi2tty
[ options ] dvi\-file
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I dvi2tty
converts a TeX DVI\-file to a format that is apprporiate for terminals
and lineprinters. The program is intended to be used for
preliminary proofreading of TeX-ed documents.
By default the output is directed to the terminal,
possibly through a pager (depending on how the program was installed),
but it can be directed to a file or a pipe.
.PP
The output leaves much to be desired, but is still
usefull if you want to avoid walking to the
laserprinter (or whatever) for each iteration of your
document.
.br
Since
.I dvi2tty
produces output for terminals and lineprinters the
representation of documents is naturally quite primitive.
Fontchanges are totally ignored, which implies that
special symbols, such as mathematical symbols, get mapped into the 
characters at the corresponding positions in the "standard" fonts.
.PP
If the width of the output text requires more columns than fits
in one line (c.f. the \-w option) it is broken into several lines by
.I dvi2tty
although they will be printed as one line on regular TeX output
devices (e.g.laserprinters). To show that a broken line is really
just one logical line an asterisk (``*'') in the last position
means that the logical line is continued on the next physical
line output by
.I dvi2tty.
Such a continuation line is started with a a space and an asterisk
in the first two columns.
.PP
Options may be specified in the environment variable DVI2TTY.
Any option on the commandline, conflicting with one in the
environment, will override the one from the environment.
.PP
.B Options:
.PP
.TP
.B \-o file
Write output to file ``file''.
.TP
.B \-p list
Print the pages chosen by list.
Numbers refer to TeX\-page numbers (known as \\count0).
An example of format for list is ``1,3:6,8''
to choose pages 1, 3 through 6 and 8.
Negative numbers can be used exactly as in TeX,
e g \-1 comes before \-4 as in ``\-p-1:-4,17''.
.TP
.B \-P list
Like \-p except that page numbers refer to
the sequential ordering of the pages in the dvi\-file.
Negative numbers don't make a lot of sense here...
.TP
.B \-w n
Specify terminal width
.I n.
Legal range 16\-132.
Default is 80. If your terminal has the
ability to display in 132 columns it might
be a good idea to use \-w132 and toggle the
terminal into this mode as output will
probably look somewhat better.
.TP
.B \-q
Don't pipe the output through a pager.
This may be the default on some systems
(depending on the whims of the SA installing the program).
.TP
.B \-f
Pipe through a pager, $PAGER if defined, or whatever your SA compiled
in (often ``more''). This may be the default, but it is still okay
to redirect output with ``>'', the pager will not be used if output
is not going to a terminal.
.TP
.B \-F
Specify the pager program to be used.
This overides the $PAGER and the default pager.
.TP
.B \-Fprog
Use ``prog'' as program to pipe output into. Can be used to choose an
alternate pager (e g ``-Fless'').
.TP
.B \-l
Mark pagebreaks with the two-character sequence ``^L''. The default is
to mark them with a formfeed character.
.TP
.B \-u
Don't make any attempts to find special Scandinavian characters.
If such characters are in the text they will map to ``a'' and ``o''.
This is probably the default outside of Scandinavia. (The SA made
the decision when  the program was installed.)
.TP
.B \-s
Try to find the special Scandinavian characters that on most (?)
terminals in Scandinavia are mapped to ``{|}[\\]''.
This can be the default, and output from files not containing these
special characters will be identical regardless of this option.
.SH FILES
/usr/ucb/more \ \ \ \ 
probably the default pager.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
PAGER \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
the pager to use.
.br
DVI2TTY \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 
can be set to hold commandline options.

.SH BUGS
Blanks between words get lost quite easy. This is less
likely if you are using a wider output than the default 80.
.PP
Only one file may be specified on the commandline.
