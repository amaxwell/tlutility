                DVI2TTY


dvi2tty is intended for previewing dvi-files on text-only
devices (terminals and lineprinters).
The program is basicly an improved C version of the pascal
program written by Svante Lindahl (see README.ORG).
I translated it because I could not find a pascal compiler 
on our machine that could compile it.
The program runs under UNIX and MSDOS without problems
It should also run under VMS. 
(you may need some site dependend redefinitions, see below).
Undocumented option: the -e option can be used to influence
the width of spaces. With a negative value the number of spaces 
between words becomes less, with a positive value it becomes more.
Just play around if you like, -e-11 worked nice with me.


                DISDVI

Disdvi is a simple hack that dumps a dvi file in a more readable form.
It is not a spectacular program but use it and improve as you wish.
I'd appreciate any enhancements made, bug reports etc. mailed to me.
  

    COMPILING THE PROGRAMS

Disdvi is rather simple and does not need any modifications.
To compile under VMS, you might need to define an extra macro:
Add a -DVMS on the command line, or add a line
#define VMS
in the dvi2tty.h file.
For dvi2tty you may find the following problems:

 function strchr() can not be found:
      Your are probably a BSD UNIX or alike.
      Solution: #define strchr index
 '/usr/bin/pg' program not found.
      Solution: change the DEFPAGER macro in dvi2tty.c
 To compile under VMS, you might need to define an extra macro:
  Add a -DVMS on the command line, or add a line
  #define VMS

Thats all, good luck.
